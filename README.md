# Simple Python Exercises (Solved)

    Q1. The program asks the user to input their surname and then their first name. The program then
    outputs the user’s first name and then their surname separately. [2]
    
    Q2. The program asks the user to input two numbers. The program multiplies them together and
    then outputs the answer. [2]
    
    Q3. Write a program that: [3]
       Asks the user for the distance (in metres).
       Asks the user for the time in seconds that a journey was completed in.
       Calculates and outputs the average speed.
    
    Q4. The program asks the user to input two numbers. It will then output the larger of these two
    numbers. [3]
    
    Q5. Write a program that: [4]
       Generates a random number between 1 and 10.
       It must then ask the user to guess this number.
       If they guess it correctly it should display ‘Correct’
       Otherwise, display ‘Not what I was thinking’
 
    Q6. Write a program that:								[4]
      Asks the user how long on average they spend watching TV each day.
      If it is less than 2 hours, outputs ‘That should be ok’
      If it is between 2 and 4 hours, outputs ‘That will rot your brain’
      Otherwise outputs “That is too much TV”

    Q7. Write a program that: Outputs all odd numbers between 1 and 20 only. 	[3]

    Q8. Create a program that will generate a random number between 1 and 3 and then use this to display a message to either walk 10km for “1”, run 5km for “2” or swim 1km for           “3”.											[4]


    Q9. The following algorithm prints out the times table of the number entered using a count-controlled loop.								[4]
      01   b = input("Enter a number") 
      02   for x = 1 to 100 
      03         print(b * x)
      04   next	
    Rewrite the algorithm to produce the same result using a condition-controlled loop.


    Q10. Create a program that calculate and report the average weight of the fruits to two decimal places. The fruits are measured in gram. Two examples of the executing solution are shown below:								[4]
    
    Q11. The flow chart of an algorithm is given. Produce a program based on the flow chart.

    Q12. Write a program that:									[5]
      Asks the user to input many cars are available for a trip.
      Asks the user to input how many people are going on the trip. 
      If there are enough seats it should output ‘We have enough seats’
      If there are not enough seats it calculates how many extra cars are needed and then output ‘Another x cars are needed’ with x being the number of cars. 
      NOTE: Assume you can fit FIVE people in each car. 

    Q13. A program for the board game needs to perform the following tasks:	[5]
      The user is asked to enter a number between 1 and 6
      The computer then rolls a random number between 1 and 6
      If the computer’s roll matches the user’s number, then a value of 10 is added to the user’s score
      The program repeats the first three bullet points five times before outputting the total score

    Q14. Create a program that will allow the user to enter a word and then count how many times the letter A appears in that word. 
      Both upper case (“A”) and lower case (“a”) letters must be counted.
      It outputs how many alphabets “a” and “A” in the word. 
      The algorithm should repeat until the word “No” is entered, this terminates the program.										[8]

    Q15. Create a solution that takes 4 numbers from a user and outputs their sum (total), max (the largest number) and min (the smallest number).				[8]
